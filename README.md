# Sentiment-Analysis---NLP

1. Data Preprocessing

    Tools Used: Libraries like NLTK, spaCy.
    Steps:
        Load the dataset (e.g., airline tweets).
        Explore the data and remove irrelevant entries like links, mentions, and noisy text.
        Clean text by removing stop words, special characters, and unnecessary tokens.
        Tokenize the text and convert it into numerical data.

2. Feature Extraction

    Techniques:
        Use Word2Vec or GloVe for embedding text into fixed-length vectors.
        Alternatively, apply tf-idf or Bag-of-Words for numerical representation.

3. Model Building

    Architecture:
        Implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using either LSTM or GRU to handle the sequential nature of text data.
        Regularization techniques: Apply dropout and batch normalization to reduce overfitting.

4. Model Training

    Steps:
        Train the RNN on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data.
        Use cross-validation to evaluate and validate model performance.
        Implement early stopping to halt training when validation performance plateaus or deteriorates.

5. Model Testing and Evaluation

    Steps:
        Test the trained RNN on unseen data to assess its predictive performance.
        Use evaluation metrics like:
            Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.
            Precision: True positives over all predicted positives.
            Recall: True positives over all actual positives.
            F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
        Use confusion matrix and ROC curve for a detailed analysis of predictions.
