# Sentiment-Analysis---NLP
The primary objective of this study is to design a robust and scalable convolutional neural network (CNN) to address challenges in sentiment analysis for text-based movie reviews. Two feature extraction techniques, Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF, were utilized and compared, with results visually represented through graphs. Metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, F1 score, and recall were employed for evaluation. Multiple models were developed, and the findings are presented in detail. Although CNNs are not a definitive solution, they provided valuable insights into sentiment analysis. The Rotten Tomatoes dataset, consisting of review phrases and corresponding sentiments, was used for training and testing. Observations and results were tabulated, concluding that TF-IDF outperforms BoW in terms of accuracy.
